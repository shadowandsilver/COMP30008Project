The design concept of ER diagram is to create individual subjects first and then connect them together by relationships. The member's form is a collection of their personal information, contact details and gym-related information. After that, Coach's form will be shorter and mainly focus on their information and years of service. We divided the three lessons into three types at first, and later we simplified private lesson when we thought it could be simplified. room and instrument had a deep connection. Because we did not want the information to be too complicated and hoped that instrument could provide more information, we divided them into two. Since the relationship of other activities and group lesson is one-to-many for both member and coach, there will be four tables between them to record information, respectively for other activities and member. other activities and coach, group lesson and member, group lesson and coach. The member and the coach have a one-to-one relationship, so they use a table. On the relevant table between member and lesson, the amount paid by the student to enroll in those courses is indicated, which can be used to calculate the loyalty point.
